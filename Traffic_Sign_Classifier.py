# ## Step 0: Load The Data

# In[1]:

# Load pickled data

import pickle

training_file = 'train.p'
testing_file = 'test.p'

with open(training_file, mode='rb') as f:
    train = pickle.load(f)
with open(testing_file, mode='rb') as f:
    test = pickle.load(f)
    
X_train, y_train = train['features'], train['labels']
X_test, y_test = test['features'], test['labels']


# ---
# 
# ## Step 1: Dataset Summary & Exploration
# 
# The pickled data is a dictionary with 4 key/value pairs:
# 
# - `'features'` is a 4D array containing raw pixel data of the traffic sign images, (num examples, width, height, channels).
# - `'labels'` is a 2D array containing the label/class id of the traffic sign. The file `signnames.csv` contains id -> name mappings for each id.
# - `'sizes'` is a list containing tuples, (width, height) representing the the original width and height the image.
# - `'coords'` is a list containing tuples, (x1, y1, x2, y2) representing coordinates of a bounding box around the sign in the image. **THESE COORDINATES ASSUME THE ORIGINAL IMAGE. THE PICKLED DATA CONTAINS RESIZED VERSIONS (32 by 32) OF THESE IMAGES**
# 
# Complete the basic data summary below.

# In[2]:

### Replace each question mark with the appropriate value.
import numpy as np
# TODO: Number of training examples
n_train = train['features'].shape[0]

# TODO: Number of testing examples.
n_test = test['features'].shape[0]

# TODO: What's the shape of an traffic sign image?
image_shape = train['features'][0].shape

# TODO: How many unique classes/labels there are in the dataset.
n_classes = np.bincount(y_train).nonzero()[0].size

print("Number of training examples =", n_train)
print("Number of testing examples =", n_test)
print("Image data shape =", image_shape)
print("Number of classes =", n_classes)


# Visualize the German Traffic Signs Dataset using the pickled file(s). This is open ended, suggestions include: plotting traffic sign images, plotting the count of each sign, etc.
# 
# The [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) [examples](http://matplotlib.org/examples/index.html) and [gallery](http://matplotlib.org/gallery.html) pages are a great resource for doing visualizations in Python.
# 
# **NOTE:** It's recommended you start with something simple first. If you wish to do more, come back to it after you've completed the rest of the sections.

### Data exploration visualization goes here.
### Feel free to use as many code cells as needed.
import random
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

get_ipython().magic('matplotlib inline')

index = random.randint(0, len(X_train))
image = X_train[index].squeeze()

plt.figure(figsize=(1,1))
plt.imshow(image)
print(y_train[index])


# ----
# 
# ## Step 2: Design and Test a Model Architecture
# 
# Design and implement a deep learning model that learns to recognize traffic signs. Train and test your model on the [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset).
# 
# There are various aspects to consider when thinking about this problem:
# 
# - Neural network architecture
# - Play around preprocessing techniques (normalization, rgb to grayscale, etc)
# - Number of examples per label (some have more than others).
# - Generate fake data.
# 
# Here is an example of a [published baseline model on this problem](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/sermanet-ijcnn-11.pdf). It's not required to be familiar with the approach used in the paper but, it's good practice to try to read papers like these.
# 
# **NOTE:** The LeNet-5 implementation shown in the [classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/fbf77062-5703-404e-b60c-95b78b2f3f9e/modules/6df7ae49-c61c-4bb2-a23e-6527e69209ec/lessons/601ae704-1035-4287-8b11-e2c2716217ad/concepts/d4aca031-508f-4e0b-b493-e7b706120f81) at the end of the CNN lesson is a solid starting point. You'll have to change the number of classes and possibly the preprocessing, but aside from that it's plug and play!

# ### Implementation
# 
# Use the code cell (or multiple code cells, if necessary) to implement the first step of your project. Once you have completed your implementation and are satisfied with the results, be sure to thoroughly answer the questions that follow.

# In[4]:

### Preprocess the data here.
### Feel free to use as many code cells as needed.
from sklearn.utils import shuffle
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

X_train, y_train = train['features'], train['labels']
X_test, y_test = test['features'], test['labels']


X_train, y_train = shuffle(X_train, y_train)



# ### Question 1 
# 
# _Describe how you preprocessed the data. Why did you choose that technique?_

# **Answer:**
# We do not want the order of the data to affect our results.

# In[5]:

### Generate data additional data (OPTIONAL!)
### and split the data into training/validation/testing sets here.
### Feel free to use as many code cells as needed.
X_validation, X_train, y_validation, y_train = train_test_split(X_train, y_train, test_size=0.2)



# ### Question 2
# 
# _Describe how you set up the training, validation and testing data for your model. **Optional**: If you generated additional data, how did you generate the data? Why did you generate the data? What are the differences in the new dataset (with generated data) from the original dataset?_

# **Answer:**
# We split 20% of training data to be validation data.

# ### Question 4
# 
# _How did you train your model? (Type of optimizer, batch size, epochs, hyperparameters, etc.)_
# 

# **Answer:**
# I used Adam Optimizer, batch size of 128 and epochs of 30.

# ### Question 5
# 
# 
# _What approach did you take in coming up with a solution to this problem? It may have been a process of trial and error, in which case, outline the steps you took to get to the final solution and why you chose those steps. Perhaps your solution involved an already well known implementation or architecture. In this case, discuss why you think this is suitable for the current problem._

# **Answer:**
# Mainly with trial and error based on the original LeCun network. Due to time constraints I did not play with dropouts and other techniques.

# ---
# 
# ## Step 3: Test a Model on New Images
# 
# Take several pictures of traffic signs that you find on the web or around you (at least five), and run them through your classifier on your computer to produce example results. The classifier might not recognize some local signs but it could prove interesting nonetheless.
# 
# You may find `signnames.csv` useful as it contains mappings from the class id (integer) to the actual sign name.

# ### Implementation
# 
# Use the code cell (or multiple code cells, if necessary) to implement the first step of your project. Once you have completed your implementation and are satisfied with the results, be sure to thoroughly answer the questions that follow.

# In[8]:

### Load the images and plot them here.
### Feel free to use as many code cells as needed.
get_ipython().magic('matplotlib inline')
import cv2
import numpy as np
import random
import PIL
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib.image as mpimg
import glob


image_list = []
for filename in glob.glob('test_image/*.*'): 
    image = mpimg.imread(filename)
    image_list.append(image)
    plt.imshow(image)
    plt.show()


# ### Question 6
# 
# _Choose five candidate images of traffic signs and provide them in the report. Are there any particular qualities of the image(s) that might make classification difficult? It could be helpful to plot the images in the notebook._
# 
# 

# **Answer:**
# They have different facing and backgrounds and some of them have poor resolution/quality.

# In[9]:

### Run the predictions here.
### Feel free to use as many code cells as needed.
with tf.Session() as sess:

    saver.restore(sess, tf.train.latest_checkpoint('.'))
    
    test = sess.run(logits, feed_dict={x: image_list})

    print(np.argmax(test,axis=1))


# ### Question 7
# 
# _Is your model able to perform equally well on captured pictures when compared to testing on the dataset? The simplest way to do this check the accuracy of the predictions. For example, if the model predicted 1 out of 5 signs correctly, it's 20% accurate._
# 
# _**NOTE:** You could check the accuracy manually by using `signnames.csv` (same directory). This file has a mapping from the class id (0-42) to the corresponding sign name. So, you could take the class id the model outputs, lookup the name in `signnames.csv` and see if it matches the sign from the image._
# 

# **Answer:**
# 17,No entry
# 14,Stop
# 8,Speed limit (120km/h)
# 
# 2 out of 5 signs were identified correctly, namely 40% accurate. Some signs were not presented in the trainingset.

# In[11]:

### Visualize the softmax probabilities here.
### Feel free to use as many code cells as needed.
softmax = tf.nn.softmax(logits)
topFive=tf.nn.top_k(softmax, k=5, sorted=True, name=None)

with tf.Session() as sess:

for i in range(len(values[0])):
    
    plot_prob(indices[0][i], values[0][i])
    
    
   



# ### Question 8
# 
# *Use the model's softmax probabilities to visualize the **certainty** of its predictions, [`tf.nn.top_k`](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.12/api_docs/python/nn.html#top_k) could prove helpful here. Which predictions is the model certain of? Uncertain? If the model was incorrect in its initial prediction, does the correct prediction appear in the top k? (k should be 5 at most)*
# 
# `tf.nn.top_k` will return the values and indices (class ids) of the top k predictions. So if k=3, for each sign, it'll return the 3 largest probabilities (out of a possible 43) and the correspoding class ids.
# 
# Take this numpy array as an example:
# 
# ```
# # (5, 6) array
# a = np.array([[ 0.24879643,  0.07032244,  0.12641572,  0.34763842,  0.07893497,
#          0.12789202],
#        [ 0.28086119,  0.27569815,  0.08594638,  0.0178669 ,  0.18063401,
#          0.15899337],
#        [ 0.26076848,  0.23664738,  0.08020603,  0.07001922,  0.1134371 ,
#          0.23892179],
#        [ 0.11943333,  0.29198961,  0.02605103,  0.26234032,  0.1351348 ,
#          0.16505091],
#        [ 0.09561176,  0.34396535,  0.0643941 ,  0.16240774,  0.24206137,
#          0.09155967]])
# ```
# 
# Running it through `sess.run(tf.nn.top_k(tf.constant(a), k=3))` produces:
# 
# ```
# TopKV2(values=array([[ 0.34763842,  0.24879643,  0.12789202],
#        [ 0.28086119,  0.27569815,  0.18063401],
#        [ 0.26076848,  0.23892179,  0.23664738],
#        [ 0.29198961,  0.26234032,  0.16505091],
#        [ 0.34396535,  0.24206137,  0.16240774]]), indices=array([[3, 0, 5],
#        [0, 1, 4],
#        [0, 5, 1],
#        [1, 3, 5],
#        [1, 4, 3]], dtype=int32))
# ```
# 
# Looking just at the first row we get `[ 0.34763842,  0.24879643,  0.12789202]`, you can confirm these are the 3 largest probabilities in `a`. You'll also notice `[3, 0, 5]` are the corresponding indices.

# **Answer:**
# Actually looking to suggestions. For the images that did not appear in the training set, the final result was pretty biased towards one single category, not as evenly distributed as in the example. For the 2 pictures that are better quality the network recognize them pretty well.
